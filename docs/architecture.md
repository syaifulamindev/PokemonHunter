# PokemonHunter Architecture Documentation
This project name is "PokemonHunter", because this app is about hunting pokemon.

# Introduction and Goals

"PokemonHunter" project is to upgrade my skills about documentation, interview, and showcase my skills.

Good documentation is the backbone of any project, fostering communication, knowledge transfer, informed decision-making, quality assurance, and streamlined maintenance. Conversely, poor documentation leads to misunderstandings, inefficiencies, and compromises the overall project quality. That's why I've opted for the arc42 template for our architecture documentation. Even in a small project, documentation remains essential to success. 

## Requirements Overview
### What is PokemonHunter?
PokemonHunter simple app to hunt a pokemon, catch, rename, and release it.

### Main features

### Pokemon List
- [x] show a list of pokemons's names and picture, other data and  is optional 
- [x] click pokemon will go to Pokemon Detail
### Pokemon Detail
- [x] show pokemon picture
- [x] show pokemon move
- [x] catch button, if success give the Pokemon a nickname and add that Pokemon to 'My Pokemon List'
     
### My Pokemon List
- [ ] show all list of pokemon that have been caught
- [ ] should be able to release pokemon
- [ ] should be able to rename pokemon
