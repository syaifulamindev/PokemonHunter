# PokemonHunter Architecture Documentation
This project name is "PokemonHunter", because this app is about hunting pokemon.

# Introduction and Goals

"PokemonHunter" project is to upgrade my skills about documentation, interview, and showcase my skills.

Good documentation is the backbone of any project, fostering communication, knowledge transfer, informed decision-making, quality assurance, and streamlined maintenance. Conversely, poor documentation leads to misunderstandings, inefficiencies, and compromises the overall project quality. That's why I've opted for the arc42 template for our architecture documentation. Even in a small project, documentation remains essential to success.
